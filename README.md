# IT115 Group 3 Class Project @ NSC

## Project Overview
[![GitHub Super-Linter](https://github.com/twopercentjazz/It115-Group-3-Project/workflows/Lint%20Code%20Base/badge.svg)](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/super-linter)

We will use a fork of [websitedemo](https://github.com/rbunge-nsc/websitedemo) as
the seed code for our project.

Our project is a site that pulls together resources for anyone who wants to learn
git and use GitHub. We used HTML, CSS, PlantUML, Visual Studio Code, gitk, GitHub,
SuperLinter and AWS. All of these technologies are free to use, except for AWS,
where we had access to a free student account through our school.

We wanted to share our journey as we learned different techniques and software
in order to become proficient in git and shared our work through GitHub. Our
site includes key items that we learned and tips for starting your own journey.

One challenge we faced was using a SuperLinter status badge at the top of the
README file to catch coding errors during pull requests. We had introduced known
errors but the linter was not catching them. We realized that super-linter.yml
had been added after the bugs were introduced. We did a fix involving the setting:
VALIDATE_ALL_CODEBASE. It had defaulted to false, meaning it would only check the
code after it was installed. We needed it to check all of the code, so we changed
it to be true.
